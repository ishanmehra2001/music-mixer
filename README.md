# music-mixer



### Installation
accessible via git hub repo

### Usage
Right now, hover over each SVG to see the response ( rest, animation and drag and drop will be added in order to make it responsive on dropping an element on it.)

### where i have reached 
AIM -
 well, i have thought to represent some indian classical instruments via this assignment of music-mixer. I have planned to have five SVGs( SVGs of 5 musicians holding 5 different instruments). these SVFs are planned to response as if they are playing the instruments when we will drag and drop an element (another SVG of an icon). for the background i have made a stage.

ACCOMPLISHMENTS -
1. I have done with the background. 
2. All 5 SVGs (musicians).
3. Their response on dropping the element. 
3. Music files.

YET TO BE DONE - 
I need to make that little icon SVG that i can drag and drop, I need to adjust the position of my responsive SVGs onthe background. setting up audio files and other JS work.

In the material folder, reference images, audios,  illustrator file, SVGs can be seen.
