# music-mixer



### Installation
accessible via git hub repo

### Usage
hover over each SVG to see the response ( rest, animation and drag and drop is added in order to make it responsive on dropping an element on it.)

### Representation of 
indian classical instruments are represented via this assignment of music-mixer. There are five SVGs( SVGs of 5 musicians holding 5 different instruments). these SVFs are planned to response as if they are playing the instruments when we will drag and drop an element (another SVG of an icon). for the background i have made a stage.
